* Comb-to-comb stabilization over 1.3-km free-space atmospheric optical link <br/>
        <dd>Stabilizing a frequency comb to an ultra-stable optical frequency reference requires a multitude of optoelectronic peripherals that have to operate under strict ambient control. We propose an utmost case of frequency comb-to-comb stabilization made through a 1.3 km free-space optical (FSO) link by coherent transfer of two separate comb lines along with a feedback suppression control of atmospheric phase noise. The FSO link offers a transfer stability of 1.7×10–15 at 0.1 s averaging, while transporting the mater comb’s stability of 1.2×10–15 at 1.0 s over the entire spectrum of the slave comb.</dd>

In the novel, *The Strange Case of Dr. Jeykll and Mr. Hyde*, Mr. Poole is Dr. Jekyll's virtuous and loyal butler. Similarly, Poole is an upstanding and effective butler that helps you build Jekyll themes. It's made by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo).

There are currently two themes built on Poole:

* [Hyde](http://hyde.getpoole.com)
* [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com)
