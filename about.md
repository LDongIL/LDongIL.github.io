### 1. Comb-to-comb stabilization over 1.3-km free-space atmospheric optical link

&nbsp;&nbsp;Stabilizing a frequency comb to an ultra-stable optical frequency reference requires a multitude of optoelectronic peripherals that have to operate under strict ambient control. We propose an utmost case of frequency comb-to-comb stabilization made through a 1.3 km free-space optical (FSO) link by coherent transfer of two separate comb lines along with a feedback suppression control of atmospheric phase noise. The FSO link offers a transfer stability of 1.7×10–15 at 0.1 s averaging, while transporting the mater comb’s stability of 1.2×10–15 at 1.0 s over the entire spectrum of the slave comb.

&nbsp;&nbsp;The usefulness of the remote comb-to-comb stabilization proposed in this research was corroborated by implementing molecular absorption spectroscopy and microwave generation by utilizing slave comb. Our remote comb-to-comb stabilization is intended to expedite diverse long-distance ground-to-ground or ground-to-satellite applications; as demonstrated here for broad-band molecule spectroscopy over a 6 THz bandwidth as well as ultra-stable microwaves generation with phase noise of -80 dBc Hz–1 at 1 Hz.
